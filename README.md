##### Background

This is my second try at making a JavaScript game. I had about three weeks of studying JavaScript behind me when I started this project and have learned enormously while developing this game. You're free to use this game or edit it the way you want to.

##### Compatibility

Tested with recent versions of most common browsers. Works best with Firefox and may have minor appearance issues with the rest.

Does NOT work on Internet Explorer.
